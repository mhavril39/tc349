\f0\fs24 \cf0 I love each of these designs because they reek of the \'9270s and they\'92re very well designed. Many would be quick to dismiss them as bad design because they\'92re outdated, but honestly they look great\'97they are just following the design trends of a different decade. Many people who would have dismissed these are creating super trendy, super clean, super minimal graphics now that will be just as dated in 30/40 years.\
